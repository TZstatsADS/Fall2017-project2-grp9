This code has the purpose of selecting essential columns/variables from the original College Scorecard Data and Merge the final data.frame with other data frames.

```{r}
data.path <- "../data/CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data/"

fulldata <- read.csv(paste(data.path, "5_Year_Data.csv", sep = ""), header = T, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#Reads file with fields that are relevant
fields <- read.csv(paste(data.path, "SelectedFields.csv", sep = ""))

#Remove any blank rows
columns <- as.character(fields[,2])
columns <- columns[!columns == ""]

#Reads the entire dataset
original.data <- read.csv(paste(data.path, "MERGED2014_15_PP.csv", sep = ""), header = T, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(original.data)[1] <- "UNITID"
